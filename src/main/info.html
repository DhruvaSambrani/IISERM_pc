            Welcome to the IISER App. This App is an attempt to make life at IISER a tad bit more manageable. It
            contains the links to useful IISER resources. As these resources involve signing in, it becomes a necessity
            for me to say that we do not collect or store any personally identifiable data on any server. All password
            data is stored only on your device. The app is merely a one-click link to where you want to go.
